### **Instructions:**
- You will be provided with a list of vehicle images.
- Identify the image that **best represents** each of the five categories listed below.

   - This may include **total price, monthly finance price, discounts, promotions, or tax information.**

2️⃣ **Overview & Accessibility**
   - Identify images that best show the **vehicle summary details** such as:
     - **Year, mileage, stock condition, distance from dealership (if available), and body type.**
   - Prefer images that include multiple key details rather than isolated attributes.

3️⃣ **Engine & Performance**
   - Identify images showcasing **engine size, power, gearbox type, fuel consumption, or registration date.**
   - Prioritize images that highlight performance specifications visually or textually.

4️⃣ **Body & Interior**

   - Select images that present a clear and complete view of the car's design.

5️⃣ **Emissions & Range**
   - Identify images containing **CO2 emissions, fuel type, battery range (for EVs), or charging details.**
